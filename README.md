School project. Dating Web Application. Coded with Antti Vornanen.
## Task
Create a dating web application which allows users to register, login, fill their profile, search and look into
the profile of other users, like them and chat with those that liked back.

## Constraints
- Front end must use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Database must be relational or graph oriented.
- ORM and User Accounts Manager is forbidden.
- Application must be mobile friendly.

## Solution
We chose to do front end with React and TypeScript, with MobX as state management. For back end we chose Rust and Actix-Web and ArangoDB as our database. We used ArangoDB's HTTP API to communicate with database.

We divided our work so that Antti focused more on front end while I on back end.

It was really interesting and fun to learn Rust in this project. Definitely my new favorite language!
